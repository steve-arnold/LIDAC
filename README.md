## Description
This is a Microsoft Windows program which can produce software signals to seize or release licenses on the Ericsson/Aastra MD110 PABX.<br><br>
Its use should be limited to correcting the license count when corruption has occurred.<br><br>
It should not be used to release licences for re-use to avoid having to purchase additional licences. Although I do not know who would complain if you did because this system is obsolete for years and the supplier no longer exists.
